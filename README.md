SHAKIL
======

Source code for assignment and their unit test 

1). Python class file in .txt format ( Shakil_8.txt ) - which needs to be renamed as Shakil_8.py
2). Python class for Unit Test in .txt format ( UnitTest.txt ) - which needs to be renamed as UnitTest.py
3). Sampple data file in .csv format (sharePrice.csv)

Please make sure to put all the files in a same directory where ever you want to run the code. The code is very generic, you can give your own sample input data file by providing the file path.
